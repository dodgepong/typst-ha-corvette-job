        == The Situation
        Harrison Armory Corvette _*Sigma*_ has disappeared somewhere over the jungle planet *Engiri*. The ship was scheduled to depart Engiri bearing valuable cargo destined for the planet's orbital platform, but after missing their scheduled check-in, the orbital platform confirmed that the corvette never left the planet.

        == The Job
        Harrison Armory representative *Kassandra Newton* (long black hair, non-nonsense attitude) has hired the PCs to retrieve a package inside of the crashed HA Corvette _Sigma_.
        The objective is a blue box bearing a red seal. Newton refuses to elaborate upon its contents, simply insisting that it be retrieved intact.

        == The Investigation
        While tracking down information about the corvette in *Engiri City*, the PCs can learn:
        #par([
          - The citizens of the city are unfamiliar with Harrison Armory. In fact, the local government has embargoed HA entirely from the planet, and have negotiated with Union to enforce the embargo.
          - The are no signs of smoke from a crash, which would have made locating the crash site easier; this is unusual.
          - Locals are aware of a regular airship trade route over the jungles, carrying daily deliveries to and from a small town outside the city. However, since yesterday, no ships have come from or gone to the town.
        ])
        #par([Embrace random character traits for NPCs using tables from The Long Rim!])

        == Finding the Crash Site
        The jungles of Engiri are treacherous, and hostile toward mechs. Traversing the jungles along the trade route is a Skill Challenge (_Lancer_, p. 47). Upon failure, the PCs' mechs take *4#glyphs.kinetic*.

        This journey is a good opportunity for players to establish group dynamics, or flesh them out if they have already been established. Encourage this with prompts: What do you think of the Pegasus pilot you're teaming up with? Does the Lich scare your character? What do you think of this job?
