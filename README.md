This is an example Typst implementation of a trifold pamphlet adaptation of the Lancer adventure [HA Corvette Job](https://hackmd.io/@Eldraen/SJd1_hBKL) by Eld.

I made this (and am publishing with Eld's blessing) as an exercise in learning [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern markup language. Feel free to use, remix, and adapt this.
